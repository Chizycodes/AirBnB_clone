# AirBnB clone project

## Description

This is a complete RESTful web application, integrating file and
database (MySQL) storage in a back-end API with front-end interfacing in a
clone of AirBnB. The front-end is designed using HTML5/CSS3 and is served using
Python Flask. The application is configured on a distributed system - two web
servers and one load balancer - with Nginx and HAProxy.

This project is still in active development, with complete functionality set to
deploy in the coming months:

<ul>
<li>A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)</li>
<li>A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic</li>
<li>A database or files that store data (data = objects)</li>
<li>An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)</li>
</ul>
